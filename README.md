## ðŸ§  Microcontroller: ATmega32U4

The **ATmega32U4** is an 8-bit AVR microcontroller from Microchip, well-suited for embedded systems, especially mobile robotics. It features:

- **Architecture**: AVR 8-bit RISC
- **Operating Voltage**: 2.7V â€“ 5.5V
- **Flash Memory**: 32 KB (4 KB used for bootloader)
- **SRAM**: 2.5 KB  
- **EEPROM**: 1 KB  
- **Clock Speed**: Up to 16 MHz  
- **I/O Pins**: 26  
- **ADC**: 10-bit, 12 channels  
- **USB Support**: Native USB 2.0 (ideal for programming and serial communication)

We chose this microcontroller for its rich feature set and integrated USB functionality, which simplifies both programming and debugging.

## ðŸ’» Development Environment

- **IDE**: [Microchip Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio) (formerly Atmel Studio)
- **Language**: C (AVR-GCC compiler)
- **Debugger/Programmer**: USB bootloader (via LUFA or Arduino-compatible bootloader)

> **Note**: Make sure you have the ATmega32U4 board drivers installed on your system to enable serial communication and flashing over USB.
